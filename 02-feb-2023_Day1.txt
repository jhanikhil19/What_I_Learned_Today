I learned from the Podcast of TRS that learning AI is super important and it will lead to wonders in future. 
Logging your data is important for learning materials which you are doing in life. 
Learn everyday for atleast 1-2 hours. Skill share - Coursera can be a method. 
Use social media for building your profile and business. Do not consume it for more than 5 mintues a day. 
Work on something everyday and you will be separate from world. 
Everything in the world is achievable. 


IDEAS: 
Writing books about my speakers of the podcasts till today I have. 
Become a good story teller, telling stories of the famous/infamous people I know.
